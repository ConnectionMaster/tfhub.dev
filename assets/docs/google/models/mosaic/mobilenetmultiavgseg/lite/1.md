## Overview
We export the model tuned by quantization aware training (QAT) in TFlite format which can be deployed and run inference on mobile device. Please check out the [TF Model Garden MOSAIC implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/projects/mosaic) for details of QAT and TFLite exporting.
